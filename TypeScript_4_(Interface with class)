/////////// now we use interface with class

// yaha ham class ko koi type nhi de sakte hai because class already has own it's type which is class
class miniUser {
    name : string;
    id : number
    //// because constracter is taking some argument so we have to give type to these argumetns
    constructor(name:string,id:number){

            this.id = id;

//// yaha ham is vari ko type dege of interface
