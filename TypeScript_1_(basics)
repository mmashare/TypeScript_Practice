{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{ TypeScipt Basics }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}

// TypeScript is an open-source extension of JavaScript that changes JavaScript from an 
//  object-oriented scripting language into a object-oriented programming language.
// TypeScript solves this issue by letting you compile your code in your IDE before testing it out.
// To get started using TypeScript the first thing you want to do is install it globally by running 
// the npm command: npm i -g typescript .
// This is because TypeScript is not a replacement for JavaScript, but a superset and 
// so it uses babel to convert all of its code into vanilla JavaScript. 

//// most of the times ts error ke nicche red line show karta hai and some when we write half code 
// in type ye uuske nicche bhi red line show karta until you write it full or properly
